[TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) is a project which offers the same Todo application implemented in different JavaScript frameworks. But these client-rendered frameworks aren't SEO-friendly and can negatively impact on page load performance.

To help solve these problems, I created Navigation TodoMVC - a project which offers the same Todo application implemented using progressive enhancement.
