# Navigation TodoMVC

[TodoMVC](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc) is a project which offers the same Todo application implemented in different JavaScript frameworks. But these client-rendered frameworks aren't SEO-friendly and can negatively impact on page load performance.

The [Navigation for ASP.NET project](http://navigation.codeplex.com/) makes building server-rendered, SEO-friendly MVC SPAs easy. To help demonstrate I created Navigation TodoMVC - a [progressively-enhanced version of this same Todo application](http://navigationtodomvc.azurewebsites.net/).
